<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>
The goal of this IVOA Note is to introduce and explain the needs 
rising from first attempts in deploying astrophysical resources 
dedicated to educational purposes inside standard VO resources.
Issues, proposed solutions and desirables are here reported to be
possibly taken into account in future modifications of relevant
standards.
</p>
<p>
In detail, here is discussed: the curation of educational resources 
inside or along with standard registration; the reasons for documents, 
tutorials and similar to be registered and searched through registries 
alongside with the means of reaching this goal; an idea for resource 
language internationalization.
</p>
<p>
VO resources as useful material for astronomy and astrophysics
education and dissemination has been proved by various international
projects and direct request for educational data publishing has arised
from networks of educational telescopes.

<h1><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Advances in technology and communications are creating new and exciting 
opportunities for teachers to bring observational astronomy into their 
classrooms. In fact, there is a growing availability of remotely controlled 
telescopes dedicated to education in many countries world-wide, from the 
Bradford Robotic Telescope on MountTeide, Tenerife (http://www.telescope.org) 
to the radio telescopes of the Radio Physics Lab, IUCAA, Pune 
(http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/rpl). In some cases, educational telescopes are 
linked into a network with the aim of guaranteeing the best observing conditions, 
including deep sky observations during regular daytime school hours, and 
the best instrument for the particular program of interest. Examples
of these networks are iTelescope.net (http://www.itelescope.net) and EuHOU-MW 
(http://euhou.obspm.fr/public).
</p>
<p>
As telescopes enter classrooms more frequently, interest is growing for a 
public archive of observations and hence for publishing and curation tools, 
together with the basic applications needed to retrieve, display
and analyze data. The VO already includes most of the technology needed 
to satisfy the requests of educational observatories. In fact, since several 
years, VO, and in particular the European project EuroVO, is devoting part 
of its resources to education (http://wwwas.oats.inaf.it/aidawp5). It is 
therefore a natural decision for VO to tackle the problem of publishing 
educational data in VO archives.
</p>
<p>
Alongside with these data collections and service based resources an important
role is played also by tutorials and use cases adopted in astrophysics dissemination.
Documented step-by-step tutorials, use cases that explain basic astrophysical 
research performed using VO tools and resources, and similar exist in various formats 
and have been translated in different lancguages. Providing a way to preserve them 
and make them easily searchable will be an added value to teachers and researchers
involved in education and dissemination, both for astrophysics and the VO.
</p>
<p>
Resource registration for both data services and documents gives a nice answer to 
the scenario here above described (while efforts for data archiving will rely upon
interested data centers), but, while technically this seems not a great problem,
from the point of view of keeping clean the resources devoted to education will
require some more effort.
</p>
<p>
Next section will discuss the idea of educational resources curation, then 
<a href="#regext">Registering Texts</a> will work out the use cases and needs for
registration of tutorials and documents. Finally, the idea of introducing language
internationalization of resources will be discussed.
</p>
</div> <!-- section Introduction -->

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="curreg">A Curated Registry for Education</a></h2>
<p>
From a technical point of view there is no need to add new elements or extensions
to the existing standard for VO Resources (<cite>std:STDREGEXT</cite>) and extensions
to let astrophysical resources devoted to educational, outreach or amateur targets.
The only real need for investigating changes in what already exists is due to a
use case's distinction between resources to be used in teaching and dissemination
versus all the research driven resources that exist in the VO.
</p>
<p>
For the sake of simplicity here we will distinguish these two groups of resources as
<i>educational</i> and <i>professional</i> but without any intent of putting them
on different levels of importance.
</p>
<div class="section">
  <h3><a id="eduvspro">Educational vs. Professional Resources</a></h3>
  <p>
  On one side, teachers and educators may find it difficult to filter out 
  from all VO resources the ones that are suitable for their tutorials and
  examples. On the other side, researchers may find annoying having,
  possibly non-trusted, resources in the output of their search. Again,
  we stress it is not a matter of the quality of the data deployed, but 
  only a distinction made upon the resources' scope. Moreover, the same 
  resource may be useful for both the goals, but this leads to the same
  point of discussion: how to properly tag resources?
  </p>
  <p>
  In the next subsection a possible tagging solution, based upon the existing
  <i>ContentLevel</i> element of VOResource, but requiring a small change
  to it is presented. The subsequent subsection describes the idea of a
  curated registry for educational resources and the reasons for it to exist.
  </p>
</div> <!-- subsection eduvspro -->

<div class="section">
  <h3><a id="contentlvl">ContentLevel granularity issue</a></h3>
  <p>
  In <cite>std:STDREGEXT</cite> already exists the <i>ContentLevel</i> element
  allowing data publishers to optionally identify their resources as being 
  suitable for one or more of the following audiences: 
  <ul>
	<li>General</li>
	<li>Elementary Education</li>
	<li>Middle School Education</li>
	<li>Secondary Education</li>
	<li>Community College</li>
	<li>University</li>
	<li>Research</li>
	<li>Amateur</li>
	<li>Informal Education</li>
  </ul>
  This element turns out to be misused by resource publisher probably because
  it is not really clear what the subtle differences between the available
  possibilities are. Probably, simplifying the view on this element, e.g.
  restricting to only three:
  <ul>
	<li>General</li>
	<li>Research</li>
	<li>Amateur</li>
  </ul>
  possible values may lead to both a better description of their resources
  by data providers and a suitable tagging solution for a first filtering on
  differently targeted resources at client level.
  </p>
  <p>
  This change in the already existing standard will require small or no 
  changes on the already registered resources (MM provide a couple of 
  figures to justify this!) and thus will not disrupt what exists or
  trouble VO publishers.
  </p>
</div> <!-- subsection contentlvl -->

<div class="section">
  <h3><a id="edureg">Curating the Edu Registry</a></h3>
  <p>
  Even in the case of the simplified <i>ContentLevel</i> tagging system
  a curated registry for educational VO resources will be useful for
  educators to easily access the wanted data and services. A good example
  for this is the educational version of the Aladin sky atlas, that has a
  built in curated set of resources suitable for educational level 
  tutorials.
  </p>
  <p>
  Curation will require some effort in managing and keeping up to date
  such a registry but, most important, has some restrictions coming from
  the IVOA resource registry architecture. 
  </p>
  <p>
  If such a registry were a standard local registry (<cite>std:RI1</cite>) 
  its resources would be harvested by the full registries: this means 
  that any educational dedicated resource will go up to the full VO 
  set of resources, which is what we don't want to happen to keep the
  <i>professional</i> side to be robust.
  </p>
  <p>
  If it were to be a full registry, it will harvest itself all the existing
  resources, and not all of them will fit or be suitable for the educational
  scope the registry has to be preservde for.
  </p>
  <p>
  What is needed is a resource (the curated registry) capable of :
  <ul>
	<li><i>manually</i> harvesting the existing VO resources 
	(e.g. from a full registry);</li>
	<li>register its own educational resources without being directly
	harvested by full registries (e.g. this could be done using a
	sibling publishing registry dedicated to host those educational
	resources that are to be harvested by the standard full registries.</li>
  </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
  The drawing in Fig. 1 exemplifies the above descripted
  scenario. This solution will, again, not touch the existing architecture
  while giving flexibility for the emerging educational resources to 
  be curated.

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="regext">Registering Texts</a></h2>
<p>Educational material is not only about services -- text-like material
like tutorials, worked-out use cases, or textbook-like material is at
least as important.  Within the VO community, there is a large body of
such material for a wide variety of audiences ranging from pre-school to
researchers (TODO: cite AIDA, EuroVO, VAO works).</p>

<p>To date, such material has been collected informally by the various
projects on plain web pages.  It was, in consequence, hard to find it.
Also, locating editable forms of such texts -- which has been found to
be necessary fairly regularly -- has been at least difficult; while
representing source-product relationships is in principle in the domain
of provenance and thus not in scope for the registry, in the case of
texts the relation is so simple and its representation so useful that we
propose to include it in a simple registry extension covering text-like
material, dubbed DocRegExt in the following.</p>

<p>The VO already has a registry extension for standards, which of
course are also text-like (<cite>std:STDREGEXT</cite>).  This extension,
however, focuses on metadata important for standards -- e.g.,
vocabularies and status -- that is not pertinent for educational
material.  Conversely, it is not concerned with document language (which
can safely be assumed to be English for standards), and it disregards
the issue of document formats, which for educational material is
important.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3><a id="regext-usecases">Use Cases</a></h3>

<p>The design of DocRegExt has been guided by the desire to fulfill the
following use cases:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is there a tutorial covering discovering intermediate mass black
holes? (Standard VOResource is sufficient)</li>
<li>Is there a tutorial covering working with X-Ray data? (Standard
VOResource is sufficient)</li>
<li>Is there a tutorial dealing with Planets suitable for school use?
(Standard VOResource is sufficient)</li>
<li>Is there a tutorial dealing with Planets suitable for school use in
Italian? (That requires the declaration of the document language)</li>
<li>What are the subjects of maintained (in the sense of: probably
working in the VO as found by the students) tutorials?
(The active flag of standard VOResource is
unsuitable here since even outdated resources will still be accessible;
therefore, we introduce the maintained flag)</li>
<li>Are there tutorials using redshifts? (This is solved by allowing
table metadata in DocRegExt)</li>
<li>Where can I find an editable version of tutorial ivo://auth/tut1?
(This is solved by allowing multiple access URLs with different content
types, which should be sufficient to allow answering the question)</li>
<li>Are there translations of tutorial ivo://auth/tut2? (This is covered
by the recommendations on declaring relationships between text-like
resources)</li>
<li>Is there material using service ivo://auth/svc1? (Again, declaring
relationships covers this use case)</li>
<li>Is there material about something visible tonight? (In principle,
allowing the coverage element withing DocRegExt resources would allow
answering the question; in reality, few registries expose this
information in useable form)</li>
</ul>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="lang">Internationalization of VO Resources</a></h2>
<p>
The EURO-VO AIDA project WP5 put some effort also in translating tutorials
in different languages, meeting the needs for high schools and lower level 
educational degrees when starting dissemination in astrophysics to an 
audience not skilled enough with the english language. It would be an added
value in this case to be able to register an educational or
documental resource not only in english (as it is done currently with 
standard VO resources) but also in other national languages.
</p>
<p>
Here what it would be nice to discuss is whether this means:
<ul>
  <li>changing VOResource to allow different languages in resource 
  descriptions;</li>
  <li>enable internazionalization in VO resources within existing
  resources: one resource described in multiple languages</li>
  <li>other...</li>
</ul>
