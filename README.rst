TextRegExt: A VOResource Extension of Educational Material
==========================================================

Use this extension to register tutorials, use cases, courses, and the
like in the VO Registry.  One benefit of doing this is that your
material will show up in the `VO Text Treasures`_ VOTT.

The current WD was derived from the IVOA Note `Educational Resources in
the Virtual Observatory`_

To build this, get ivoatex' dependencies (see ivoatexDoc_) and run make.

A stable and published version of this will be at
http://ivoa.net/documents/TextRegExt.
